# COVID-19 Government Policy Effectiveness
This project analyzes the relationship between government policy and the spread of COVID-19 by U.S. state using COVID-19 policy and R-value data from March 3rd to July 31st.

The goal was to look into the system of government policy and the spread of COVID-19 to help understand how effective our current government policies have been in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

# Instructions:

Download the COVIDDataAnalyzer.py file and all the datasets from the Data folder.

# Results:

Running the code properly will produce histograms and/or scattergrams depicting the relationship between government policy strictness and R-Value for the states.

# Data:

The original R-Value dataset can be found at https://d14wlfuexuxgcm.cloudfront.net/covid/rt.csv on https://rt.live/

The original state government policy dataset can be found from https://github.com/KFFData/COVID-19-Data/tree/kff_master/State%20Policy%20Actions/State%20Social%20Distancing%20Actions

I altered the original data by alphabatizing the states in all datasets and organizing the R-Value data by date from earliest to lastest.
